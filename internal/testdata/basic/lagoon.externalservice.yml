    # this is an example of defining a simple network policy directly on an environment

# network-policies allow you to restrict which organizations, projects, or environments, can access a specific service
# in the environment this policy is created in
# network-policies only work if the environments are in the same cluster
# this example is only to show how it could be used to create complex network policies if required
# default network policies are to reject all ingress traffic from other lagoon environments
# so all network policies are configured to allow from other environments only
# there are some ways to exclude some traffic by setting policies that use exclude-projects or exclude-environments within
# network-policies can also be defined under an environment in the environments section
